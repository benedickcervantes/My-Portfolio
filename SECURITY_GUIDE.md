# Security Guide for Environment Variables

## ‚úÖ Your .env.local File is Secured

### Current Security Measures:

1. **File Permissions**: Set to 600 (read/write for owner only)
   - Only you can read or modify the file
   - Other users cannot access it

2. **Git Ignore**: Properly excluded from version control
   - `.env*` pattern in .gitignore prevents accidental commits
   - Your credentials will never be pushed to GitHub

3. **EmailJS Credentials**: Already configured and working
   - Service ID: service_866zmoo
   - Template ID: template_8t45f9a
   - Public Key: hg6wEXmIU98lJUkes

### Additional Security Best Practices:

#### ‚úÖ DO:
- Keep your .env.local file local only
- Use different credentials for development/production
- Regularly rotate your EmailJS keys
- Never share your .env.local file
- Use strong, unique passwords for EmailJS account

#### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Commit .env.local to git
- Share credentials in chat/email
- Use production keys in development
- Store credentials in code comments
- Upload .env.local to cloud storage

### For Production Deployment:

When deploying to Vercel/Netlify:
1. Add environment variables in your hosting platform's dashboard
2. Use the same variable names:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY
3. Never commit production credentials to git

### File Structure:
```
My-Portfolio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.local          # ‚úÖ Secured (600 permissions, git ignored)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore          # ‚úÖ Contains .env* pattern
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SECURITY_GUIDE.md   # ‚úÖ This guide
```

### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check file permissions (should show -rw-------)
ls -la .env.local

# Verify git ignores the file (should show nothing)
git status --porcelain | grep env

# Check gitignore contains .env*
grep -n "\.env" .gitignore
```

Your environment variables are properly secured! üîí
